<h1>Devblog: New Mechanics & Sandwhisper</h1>

<p>This devblog covers update <strong>5.1</strong>, coming in August, and introduces two major new systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new map system with pathfinding and a layer-based world structure</li>
  <li>Multi-character combat on the same account</li>
</ul>

<p>Rolling out such big changes mid-season might seem unusual, but it will allow me to analyze player comprehension and balance these mechanics before deploying them across the full game.</p>

<p>These systems will be fully leveraged on <strong>Sandwhisper Isle</strong> and will be rolled out across the game world in the next season. So don't worry about your bots — everything should continue working the same on current content.</p>

<p>But before diving into Sandwhisper, let's take a look at the two new gameplay mechanics.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Map System</h2>

<p>One of the big upcoming changes is the complete rework of the map system. This will bring major changes to how you navigate in <strong>Artifacts</strong>.</p>

<h3>1. Goodbye Rectangular Maps, Welcome Pathfinding (A*)!</h3>

<p>Maps now have an <code>access</code> property, making the world more coherent: with water, mountains, and obstacles. Not all maps will be accessible anymore.</p>

<p>Some maps will require teleportation (via potion), while others will have specific conditions — such as owning an item or reaching a certain level.</p>

<p><strong>Added to the <code>MapSchema</code> model:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  "access": {
    "type": "standard/blocked/conditional/teleport_required",
    "conditions": []
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Logs and responses will now include the path your character used, helping you optimize travel.</p>

<h3>2. A World Made of Layers!</h3>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/90m8D8T.gif" alt="layers">

<p>The world is now made up of <strong>three layers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>interior</code></li>
  <li><code>overworld</code></li>
  <li><code>underground</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Characters using the <code>Move</code> endpoint will move within a single layer. But they can now <strong>transition between layers</strong> using the new endpoint:</p>

<p><code>/my/{character}/action/transition</code> — with the help of potions or items.</p>

<p><strong>Example map object:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "map_id": 1231,
    "name": "Sandwhisper Isle",
    "skin": "desertisland_10",
    "x": -3,
    "y": 19,
    "layer": "overworld",
    "content": {
      "type": "monster",
      "code": "sandwarden"
    },
    "access": {
      "type": "standard",
      "conditions": []
    },
    "transition": {
      "map_id": 1233,
      "x": -3,
      "y": 19,
      "layer": "interior",
      "cost": {
        "gold": null,
        "items": [
          {
            "code": "sandwhisper_key",
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>These changes introduce a <strong>map ID</strong>, which uniquely identifies each map — since different layers can share the same coordinates.</p>

<p>The existing endpoints will remain compatible with coordinates, now with layer precision, and new endpoints will also support map IDs.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>big transition</strong>, but I’m really excited to introduce it.</p>
<p>While only the new zone will benefit from it initially in 5.1, the rest of the game world will be updated progressively.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Multi-Character Combat</h2>

<p>One of the most requested features is finally coming: <strong>multi-character combat</strong>, arriving with update <strong>5.1</strong>!</p>

<p>This required several fundamental changes to the combat system.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Combat System</h3>

<p>Gone are the days of your character always starting first. Introducing a new stat: <strong>initiative</strong> — determining turn order between characters and monsters.</p>

<blockquote><em>All existing monsters will have zero initiative and still act second (as they do now). Their stats will only be updated next season to avoid breaking current scripts.</em></blockquote>

<p>A second new stat is also introduced: <strong>threat</strong> — relevant only for multi-character battles, as it affects which character the monster is likely to attack.</p>

<h3>Monster Types</h3>

<p>Monsters now fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>normal</code></li>
  <li><code>elite</code>: Stronger than normal monsters of the same level, protecting rare resources (e.g., Lich, Rosenblood)</li>
  <li><code>boss</code>: The only monsters that can be fought in groups</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Multi-Character Combat Works</h3>

<p>Group battles are as simple as regular ones:  
All characters must be on the monster’s map. A new endpoint allows you to specify which characters will join the fight. You can engage with <strong>up to 3 or 4</strong> characters from your account.</p>

<blockquote><em>The feature is still in development, and the final limit on the number of characters in a fight hasn’t been confirmed yet.</em></blockquote>

<p>Since the system is still actively being developed, I’ll wait before diving into the details of equipment, runes, or utilities — but there will be <strong>boss-focused content</strong> with mechanics giving specific <strong>roles</strong> to your characters.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sandwhisper Isle</h2>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5fRjfZt.png" alt="Logo">

<p><strong>Sandwhisper Isle</strong> is the new zone for characters <strong>level 40 to 50</strong>.</p>

<p>It includes <strong>new resources</strong>, <strong>five new monsters</strong> (including <strong>two group bosses</strong>), and is the <strong>first zone to use the new map system</strong>.</p>

<p>The island will cost <strong>1000 gold per trip</strong>, so you might want to find a way to access its bank.<br>
Apparently, you’ll need to <strong>earn its trust</strong> before they’ll let you in...</p>

<p>Too many pirates have been trying to loot the island...</p>

<hr>

<p>For now, I’ll stop here and let you discover the <strong>bosses and secrets</strong> of this mysterious new island.<br>
See you in <strong>August</strong>!</p>

<p>Thanks,<br><strong>muigetsu</strong></p>
